# Nextion-GUI-Development for an Automated Plant Care
This project involves Arduino and HMI files on GUI development for NEXTION Enhanced Touchscreen Display.
Brief footage of the system can be seen through "InShot_20161226.mp4" video file. 
( Current visuals of video belong to a completed (26.12.2016) term project for an elective course EE0210 by M.Murat AKCAYIGIT and H.Ayberk BULUT. The purpose of the project was to bring plant care at people's fingertips with a friendly user interface.)

Now, my purpose is to upgrade the system to become fully Automated Plant Caring device with listed specifications below:

-Automated Irrigation
    : User will input Frequency & Required amount of water (milliliter).
    
-Automated Plant growth LED
    : User will input Frequency & Required Amount of growth led on time
    
-Automated Cooling fan
    : User will input Treshold Temp. Value & On time of cooling fan
