Important !

If you are going to use SoftwareSerial for Arduino Uno, you need to add these lines in NexConfig.h file:

#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
extern SoftwareSerial HMISerial;
#define nexSerial HMISerial

For arduino code we add these lines:
#include "Nextion.h"
SoftwareSerial HMISerial(10,11);
